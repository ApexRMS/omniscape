# Getting started with the **omniscape** SyncroSim Package

### Here we provide guided tutorials on the **omniscape** SyncroSim Package, an open-source SyncroSim package for running Omniscape.jl. 

The tutorials will introduce you to the basics of working with the **omniscape** SyncroSim Package. The steps include:

* Installing SyncroSim and Julia
* Reproducing the Omniscape.jl example with the **omniscape** SyncroSim Package
* Creating a reproducible workflow for the **omniscape** SyncroSim Package in R

<br>

## **Installing SyncroSim and Julia**

Running the **omniscape** SyncroSim Package requires that SyncroSim and Julia be installed on your computer. Download SyncroSim version 2.4.5 or higher [here](https://syncrosim.com/download/){:target="_blank"} and follow the installation prompts. Download Julia version 1.5.4 or higher [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/){:target="_blank"} and follow the installation prompts. Once these requirements are installed, you are ready to follow along with the tutorials.

## **Creating a reproducible workflow for the omniscape SyncroSim Package in R**

This video tutorial will cover how to use the [rsyncrosim](https://syncrosim.github.io/rsyncrosim/){:target="_blank"} R package to interact with the **omniscape** SyncroSim Package in R.

If you'd like to follow along with the tutorial, download R and the R Studio IDE [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){:target="_blank"} and follow the installation prompts.

The steps include:
* Reproducing the Omniscape.jl example in R using rsyncrosim
* Performing a sensitivity analysis on an **omniscape** SyncroSim parameter
