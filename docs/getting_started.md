# Getting started with **omniscape**

### Here we provide guided tutorials on **omniscape**, an open-source SyncroSim package for running Omniscape.jl. 

The tutorials will introduce you to the basics of working with **omniscape**. The steps include:

* <a href="#part1"> Installing SyncroSim and julia </a>
* <a href="#part2"> Reproducing the Omniscape.jl example with <b>omniscape</b> SyncroSim  </a>
* <a href="#part3"> Creating a reproducible workflow for <b>omniscape</b> in R </a>

<br>

<p id="part1"> <h2> <b>Installing SyncroSim and julia</b> </h2> </p>

Running **omniscape** requires that the SyncroSim software be installed on your computer. Download SyncroSim version 2.4.5 or higher [here](https://syncrosim.com/download/){:target="_blank"} and follow the installation prompts. Running **omniscape** also requires julia version 1.5.4 or higher. Download julia [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/){:target="_blank"} and follow the installation prompts. Once the required programs are installed, you are ready to follow along the tutorials.

<p id="part2"> <h2> <b>Reproducing the Omniscape.jl example with omniscape SyncroSim</b> </h2> </p>

This video tutorial will provide an overview of working with **omniscape** SyncroSim by reproducing the [Omniscape.jl example](https://docs.circuitscape.org/Omniscape.jl/stable/examples/){:target="_blank"}. 

The steps include:

* Installing the **omniscape** package
* Creating and configuring a new **omniscape** library
* Creating and editing scenarios
* Running the model
* Visualizing the results



<br>

<p id="part3"> <h2> <b>Creating a reproducible workflow for omniscape in R</b> </h2> </p>

This video tutorial will cover how to use the [rsyncrosim](https://syncrosim.github.io/rsyncrosim/){:target="_blank"} R package to interact with **omniscape** SyncroSim in R.

As such, this video tutorial further requires R be installed in your computer. Download R and the R Studio IDE [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){:target="_blank"} and follow the installation prompts. Once installation is complete, you are ready to follow along the video.

The steps include:
* Reproducing the Omniscape.jl example in rsyncrosim
* Performing a sensitivity analysis on an **omniscape** parameter
