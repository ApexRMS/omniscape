# Getting started with the **omniscape** SyncroSim Package

### Here we provide guided tutorials on the **omniscape** SyncroSim Package, an open-source SyncroSim package for running Omniscape.jl. 

The tutorials will introduce you to the basics of working with the **omniscape** SyncroSim Package. The steps include:

* Installing SyncroSim and Julia
* Reproducing the Omniscape.jl example with the **omniscape** SyncroSim Package
* Creating a reproducible workflow for the **omniscape** SyncroSim Package in R

<br>

## **Installing SyncroSim and Julia**

Running the **omniscape** SyncroSim Package requires that SyncroSim and Julia be installed on your computer. Download SyncroSim version 2.4.5 or higher [here](https://syncrosim.com/download/){:target="_blank"} and follow the installation prompts. Download Julia version 1.5.4 or higher [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/){:target="_blank"} and follow the installation prompts. Once these requirements are installed, you are ready to follow along with the tutorials.

## **Reproducing the Omniscape.jl example with omniscape SyncroSim Package**

This video tutorial will provide an overview of working with the **omniscape** SyncroSim Package in the Windows user interface and demonstrate how to reproduce the [Omniscape.jl example](https://docs.circuitscape.org/Omniscape.jl/stable/examples/){:target="_blank"}. 

The steps include:

* Installing the **omniscape** SyncroSim Package
* Creating and configuring a new the **omniscape** SyncroSim Library
* Creating and editing scenarios
* Running the model
* Visualizing the results

> **Note:** Before running a scenario, you need to specify the path to the Julia executable file. To do so, open the Library Properties, and under the Julia Configuration datasheet, click on the import button to navigate to the Julia executable file. If in the default location, you will find it at C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Local\Programs\Julia-1.8.2\bin\julia.exe. The AppData folder is sometimes hidden. To see it, in File explorer, select View > Show > Hidden items.

## **Creating a reproducible workflow for the omniscape SyncroSim Package in R**

This video tutorial will cover how to use the [rsyncrosim](https://syncrosim.github.io/rsyncrosim/){:target="_blank"} R package to interact with the **omniscape** SyncroSim Package in R.

If you'd like to follow along with the tutorial, download R and the R Studio IDE [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){:target="_blank"} and follow the installation prompts.

The steps include:
* Reproducing the Omniscape.jl example in R using rsyncrosim
* Performing a sensitivity analysis on an **omniscape** SyncroSim parameter
